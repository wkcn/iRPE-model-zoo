# iRPE Model Zoo

Thanks for your attention to our work : )

It is the model zoo about the ICCV 2021 paper [`Rethinking and Improving Relative Position Encoding for Vision Transformer`](https://houwenpeng.com/publications/iRPE.pdf).

We release **the code** in the project [`microsoft/automl`](https://github.com/microsoft/AutoML/tree/main/iRPE).
